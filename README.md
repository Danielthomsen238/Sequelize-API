##Sequelize-api 
This is an ORM with Node.js and Express used to set up APIs. In this case, it is used for an admin dashboard to handle the connection between the admin dashboard and the front-end app and database.
It is also used for user login and with a SMTP server, so that the user/admin receives an email when a new user is created. It also handles OTP (one-time password) requests if the user forgets their password.
The API part is used for users to create schools, hubs, startup communities, and courses for entrepreneurs. These will be shown on the front-end app, which is an interactive map with the locations that are added in the admin dashboard
